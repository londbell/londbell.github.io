直到消亡为止，IE浏览器都是web开发者最讨厌的浏览器。不过IE已经成为了过去式，它被更好的微软Edge浏览器替代。

为什么开发者和软件工程师如此延误IE浏览器呢，因为IE是如此的过时，对前沿的Web Api及我们正在使用的现代化网站、应用的支持非常糟糕。

With IE now out of the way, the distinction of ‘most-hated browser’ goes to Apple’s Safari – which all along had been a close second to IE.

In a similar vein, Safari has consistently lagged behind competing browsers in supporting modern web APIs and features, presenting considerable challenges for developers wanting to create products that work consistently across all the major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari).

However, the annoyance with Safari gets deeper and more nuanced, which I’ll explain further below.
